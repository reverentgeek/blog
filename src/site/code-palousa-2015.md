Last week I had the privilege of being a part of [Code PaLOUsa](http://codepalousa.com/) in Louisville, KY. I have spoken at Code PaLOUsa conferences in the past, but this was my first time attending as a speaker and a sponsor.

Being a sponsor gave me a small glimpse into how hard the volunteers work to make this great conference such a wonderful success. [Chad Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadwickgreen) and his staff have a passion for the community, and are Just Good PeopleTM.

I wasn't able to attend many sessions. However, the opportunities to connect with developers and other speakers made the trip _all worthwhile_.

I really enjoyed giving my ["Do you even Kanban?"](http://www.slideshare.net/reverentgeek/do-you-even-kanban) and ["Intro to Node.js"](http://www.slideshare.net/reverentgeek/intro-to-nodejs-for-net-developers) talks. I received a lot of helpful feedback.

One thing I found out on this trip is the [Louisville Mega Cavern](http://www.louisvillemegacavern.com/). It's a limestone quarry turned into an underground park with zip lines, ropes course, and **17** miles of bike trails! Next time I come to Louisville, I must check this out!

Thanks Code PaLOUsa for another great conference! Thank you for the support and opportunities to speak! See you all again next time!
