_It is my pleasure to present this community tribute to Brendan Forster, written by guest author [Mord Zuber](https://twitter.com/mordzuber)._

I first met Brendan when I was looking for an open source project I could contribute to. At that point in the time, the only language I felt comfortable enough to contribute with was C#. I came across [octokit.net](https://octokit.github.io/), and started working on one of the open issues.

Brendanâ€™s happiness to help, and the length he will go to help a new contributor's pull request get merged, have served as a definitive guide on how to be an OSS maintainer.

I have immensely enjoyed Brendan's talks and the interactions I've had with him at conferences. Thank you, Brendan, for making an impact on the community!
