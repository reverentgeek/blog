<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I've been a &quot;fat kid&quot; all my life. In school, I didn't play sports, and regularly felt humiliated in gym class. As an adult, my mass has been on an upward trend. Sure, I've been able to get my weight under control a few times. But, the weight loss came at extreme, unsustainable measures, and the joy never lasted long. Add the fact that my family has a history of diabetes, and... well, you get the picture.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Jul/me-value-sized.jpg" alt="Value-sized Me"> <em>Here's a &quot;value-sized&quot; me visiting the in-laws.</em></p>
<p>At the start of 2014, I was a hefty 275 pounds with a 46-inch waist. Not the heaviest I've ever been, but not far from it. My wife and I were both miserable with ourselves, and at our wits' end.</p>
<p>My wife's sisters were having great success with &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trim-Healthy-Mama-Pearl-Barrett/dp/0988775115/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405427247&amp;sr=8-1">Trim Healthy Mama</a>&quot; by Pearl Barrett and Serene Allison. And, by success, I mean losing <em>all</em> excess fat <em>and</em> keeping it off.</p>
<p>We were reluctant to start, because the &quot;plan&quot; seemed complicated at first. There are rules about which foods are acceptable, and which foods you can eat together. Yet, the more we read, and the more recipes we added to our daily meals, the easier it got. I learned more about how our body metabolizes foods, and why other seemingly contradictory diets work.</p>
<p>The plan in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat protein at every meal</li>
<li>Don't eat fats and carbohydrates together</li>
<li>No sugar, flour, or other foods that spike your blood sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>By separating fats and carbohydrates, your body can metabolize one energy source, and then burn stored fat. Science.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six months later, my wife and I have lost over 40 pounds. Each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, here's the bottom line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in my life, I have hope. I believe I will not only lose as much weight as I want, but I will also be able to <em>keep it off</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love what we eat. It's not too hard. I don't feel like I'm deprived or suffering. Whenever I go &quot;off plan,&quot; I don't feel like throwing in the towel and giving up afterwards. The principles in &quot;Trim Healthy Mama&quot; (THM) are the <em>lifestyle</em> changes I never experienced before.</p>

<p>From the wife:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The THM Facebook communities are a wonderful source of encouragement, inspiration, tips, and recipes. I especially appreciate the fact that THM is family-friendly. I don't have to cook separate meals for our kids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still have a long way to go. It's possible we could slip back into our old habits. But, this time it feels different. I tell you, I am excited about the future, and it feels great.</p>
<p>I hope this encourages you to make a positive change. You can do it, too. Leave a comment and let me know if I can help, or hit me up on the <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek">Twitters</a>.</p>
