When it comes to the work you do, have you ever dreamed big? Not just a title or paycheck. What kind of role, responsibilities, or tasks would motivate you to jump out of bed, even on a Monday? ðŸ™ƒ

This past year has had me thinking about this topic a lot. What I love about programming, illustrations, music, writing, and other creative work are these magical moments when I get completely engrossed in imagining, questioning, exploring, designing, solving, and building. Teaching, inspiring, and encouraging others is also rewarding.

About 12 years ago, I transitioned from software development to Developer Relations (DevRel), which has given me a lot more creative freedom (at times). It's the closest "dream job" I can imagine. However, securing a full-time DevRel role over the past few years has been a real struggle.

> By the way, if you know of a role that could use a combination of programming, illustration/design, and music, please let me know!

So, this leads me to wonder, "Should I create my dream job?" Should I pursue a second career in graphic design and illustration? Music? Teaching? Should I produce training courses with my illustrations and music? A YouTube channel (or multiple channels)? Can I create a viable product or service that combines these interests?

Or should you and I be content with any job, regardless of purpose or meaning, and do our best to pursue our passions in what little free time we have left? ðŸ˜¬
