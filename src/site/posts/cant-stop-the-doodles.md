Ever since I discovered [what an impact hand-drawn illustrations can have on an audience](https://medium.com/@reverentgeek/captivate-your-audience-using-simple-illustrations-5bf0fcd0e301#.gxhgacwox), I've been using them more and more in all of my presentations. It's become so much fun, I've been drawing more as a hobby, too.

Below is a collection of some of my recent favorites from [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/reverentgeek) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reverentgeek/).
