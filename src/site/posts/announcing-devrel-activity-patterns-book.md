I'm proud to announce "Developer Relations Activity Patterns," a super-practical guide to understanding, applying, and measuring DevRel for your organization! A book that doesn't just tell you *what* DevRel is, it shows you *how* to actually do it.

## What's Inside

The book presents **39 focused patterns** covering the full spectrum of developer relations work. Whether you're a solo advocate at a startup or leading a larger DevRel team, these patterns give you practical, real-world strategies you can actually implement.

But here's what really sets this book apart: **every pattern includes metrics**.

"But, how do we measure..." is always the million-dollar question, right? Metrics are often the silent killer of DevRel efforts. But we intentionally built measurable outcomes into each pattern because knowing *whether something is working* is just as important as knowing how to do it in the first place.

## Who It's For

This book is for anyone trying to figure out how to:

- Build meaningful relationships with developer communities
- Align DevRel initiatives with business goals without selling your soul
- Scale your efforts without burning out
- Actually measure the impact of your work
- Create a shared vocabulary for talking about DevRel at a higher level

Whether you're just starting in DevRel or you've been at it for years, there's something here for you.

## A Labor of Love (and Art)

I also got to flex my creative muscles on this project. I illustrated the book cover and every chapter. Each illustration captures the essence of the patterns in that section, adding a visual dimension to the concepts. It was a fun way to blend my technical and artistic sides, and I hope the illustrations make the book even more enjoyable to read!

## The Dream Team

I got to work alongside some amazing people on this: [Ted Neward](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedneward/), [Chris (Woody) Woodruff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswoodruff/), and [Scott McAllister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stmcallister/). And, I am so proud to have [Mary Thengvall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marythengvall/) and [Scott Hanselman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanselman/) contribute forewords to the book!

The book is available now from [APress](https://link.springer.com/book/9798868818943), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Developer-Relations-Activity-Patterns-Management/dp/B0FJWPD3CQ/), and wherever technical books are sold.

Here's to building better developer communities, one pattern at a time! 🚀
