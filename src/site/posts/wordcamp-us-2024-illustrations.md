[Earlier this year](/wordcamp-eu-2024-illustrations/) I had an incredible opportunity to draw avatars at the [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) booth at WordCamp EU in Turin, Italy. I was delighted to be asked to reprise my role at [WordCamp US 2024](https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/) in Portland, Oregon!

I stayed _very_ busy each day drawing avatars while attendees watched and engaged in conversation at the booth. I was also very encouraged by all the positive feedback I received, including folks who returned with colleagues in tow for their turn at a drawing.

## A Visit to the Pacific Northwest

My wife joined me on this adventure, and we were able to visit one of our sons that currently lives in the Seattle area. We enjoyed lots of great food, and the beautiful parks at [Mount Rainier](https://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm) and [Multnomah Falls](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/crgnsa/recarea/?recid=30026).

## Portland Coffee and Guitars

As on any trip, one of my favorite things to do is to seek out great coffee and guitar stores. Portland did not disappoint! My favorite coffee of the trip turned out to be [Push X Pull](https://pushxpullcoffee.com/), who was there at WordCamp making coffee for attendees at the [JetPack](https://jetpack.com/) booth. We visited their Portland store and got to enjoy more amazing coffee and their breakfast sandwiches.

I was very impressed with Portland's [Thunder Road Guitars](https://www.thunderroadguitars.com/) and [Five Star Guitars](https://www.fivestarguitars.com/). I had the opportunity to check out quite a few guitars I had never tried before, including several [Anderson Guitarworks](https://www.andersonguitarworks.com/) custom guitars. Tom Anderson's guitars may be my new favorite electric guitars!
