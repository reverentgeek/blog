Oh Great Cloud,

Grant me the courage to write the code I can,  
to escalate the tickets I cannot fix,  
and the wisdom to know the difference.

Programming one day at a time,  
enjoying one function at a time;  
accepting bugs as a pathway to code complete;  
taking this terrible codebase as it is;  
not as I would have it;  
trusting that all things will be made right  
if I surrender to writing tests and documentation;  
so that I may be reasonably happy at the end of the day  
and somewhat sane at the end of this release.

Amen
