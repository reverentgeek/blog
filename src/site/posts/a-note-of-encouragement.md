Earlier this year, I set up a new computer for my son. In the process, I created an "Easter Egg" for him to find. I left a note on the desktop with some instructions on how to run a command-line interface (CLI) application I created.

```sh
> heybuddy
```

![Hey buddy, I just want you to know... I know you can do it. Don't give up.](/content/images/2019/10/hey-buddy.png)

As I hoped, I'll sometimes walk by and see he has a terminal window open and has run the app several times ðŸ˜Š

The source code for this application is on [GitHub](https://github.com/reverentgeek/notes-of-encouragement-cli). It's written in JavaScript and uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). There are instructions in the `readme` on how to customize the messages, change the name of the CLI app itself, and install it on someone's computer.

You can certainly take the idea and create your own customized encouragement CLI app, or take it further to create a web, desktop, or mobile application. Or, how about an encouragement robot!

Use the power of technology to make a positive impact on the people you care about! Let me know if there's anything I can do to help ðŸ™‚ Thanks for reading, and hope you have an awesome day!
