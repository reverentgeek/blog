A little more than a year ago, I wrote about accessing [SQL Server from Node.js using Edge.js](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1852/how-to-leverage-sql-server-with-nodejs-using-edgejs). Technology can change a lot in a year, and I'm happy to report the Node.js modules for SQL Server have greatly improved. Not only that, but some of the brilliant developers I work with at [LeanKit](http://leankit.com) have created seriate, designed to make working with SQL Server from Node.js as painless and friction-free as possible.

I've written an [introduction to seriate](http://developer.leankit.com/painless-sql-server-with-nodejs-and-seriate/) over on our new and shiny [LeanKit Developer Blog](http://developer.leankit.com). It really is a wonderful approach to managing data in SQL Server, and I hope you check it out.

By the way, seriate is just "the tip of the iceberg" among the amazing catalog of open source projects available at [LeanKit Labs](https://github.com/leankit-labs). Expect to see more articles on these projects in the future!
