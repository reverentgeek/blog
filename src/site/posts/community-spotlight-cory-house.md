Perhaps you've seen one of Cory's [Pluralsight courses](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cory-house). Or, sat in one of his talks. Perhaps you've run across his [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) React + Redux starter kit.

You might be thinking, "This guy seems really nice. I wonder if he's this nice in 'real life'?"

I've had the pleasure of crossing paths with Cory at conferences for many years. I can tell you. He's the real deal.

Every conversation I've had with Cory, I've come away inspired. He's not only courteous and respectful, I sincerely believe he listens and _values_ everyone's opinions.

Cory, thank you for not only doing awesome work, but lifting the developer community in so many ways.
