Hello, I am a creative professional.

* I _create_ software.
* I _create_ content.
* I _create_ illustrations.
* I _create_ music.

I love generative AI.

I use AI tools more and more. It's unlocked more creativity, ideas, and productivity. It helps me break loose when I get stuck. It's incredible and empowering and will only get better.

I love generative AI.

Since 2018, I've enjoyed a nice little side hustle of drawing cartoon avatars and silly illustrations for people. The illustration work never amounted to a livable income. Still, it provided a nice bonus of extra "fun" money that my family and I could use towards our hobbies and travel. Plus, it's something I really, really enjoy doing.

In the last 12 months, my illustration business has dropped more than 50%.

I hate generative AI.

It's sad, but I totally get it. Generative AI satisfies people's curiosity and provides the entertainment value that used to only come from paying an artist.

If I had access to these AI tools years ago, I may have never developed the illustration skills I have today.

I _hate_ generative AI.

We will effectively lose many creative skills to a new generation without the incentive and motivation to learn them.

It isn't the first time in history we've lost amazing skills and craftsmanship to innovation. And it won't be the last.

We'll find new ways to be creative with our new tools. Things we've never done before. Things we never imagined before. We will one day think, "How did we ever live without this?"

I love generative AI.
