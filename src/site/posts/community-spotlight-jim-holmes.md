It's my privilege to know Jim Holmes. He's one of my heroes. I owe Jim many, many thanks for the positive impact he's made on my career and personal life.

I first met Jim when we worked at Telligent, around 2008. He took on the monumental task of software quality and testing. Not only did he make a huge difference to the product, he left a significant mark on everyone in the company with his infectious passion, dedication, and snarky get-off-my-lawn-no-bull attitude.

### CodeMash

Maybe you've heard about this little conference named [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/)? Held at an indoor water park in the winter? Tickets sell out in minutes?

The genius behind it: Jim Holmes.

Jim handed over the reigns some time ago, but his legacy is cemented in creating one of the best software developer conferences. Ever. Countless developers _and_ their families have benefited.

### A True MVP

Jim fights tirelessly for just and noble causes:

* Bacon
* Software Quality & Automated Testing
* Project Management
* Opposing the use of the phrase "best practices"
* Abolishing SharePoint
* Tabs vs. Spaces

### Until next time...

Jim, I don't know when our paths will cross again, but I'm looking forward to it including bacon, guitars, and lots of laughs.
