I've finally checked off a dream I've had for many years! At [WordCamp EU 2024](https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/), I had the absolute pleasure of drawing custom avatars (and Wapuus) for the [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) booth ðŸ˜Š It was a blast!

At the booth, attendees could roll a die ðŸŽ² to win a prize. Two of those prizes were an avatar and a custom Wapuu illustration. I had an external monitor attached to my iPad, and folks gathered around to watch me draw! I stayed _very_ busy, drawing nearly non-stop for two days, plus several more after the event to catch up!

What's a _Wapuu_? The Wapuu is the WordPress mascot character. There are [lots of them](https://wapu.us/)! For example, I drew a custom Wapuu for a software developer at the event.

## How Did This Happen?!

Earlier in the year, I created some illustrations for [Daniel Bachhuber](https://x.com/dbchhbr) for a blog post, "[Running A Billion Dollar Business](https://wordpress.com/blog/2024/02/27/running-a-billion-dollar-business/)." Sometime later, I was contacted by an events manager asking if I'd be interested in drawing illustrations in real-time at a booth for an upcoming event.

"Hmm... let me think... YES!!"

## Turin Italy is Amazing

The icing on the cake was visiting Turin (Torino). Turin is in northern Italy near the Alps. When the sky was clear, the mountains were beautiful to see. Among other things, I visited the [National Museum of Cinema](https://www.museocinema.it/) and the [National Automobile Museum](https://www.museoauto.com/). And I got to ride an express train from Milan to Turin that traveled 300 km/h!

## Let me Draw for You!

Does drawing avatars, caricatures, or other custom illustrations sound like a fun way to engage your audience? I would absolutely love more opportunities to do this kind of work. [Let's talk](mailto:david@reverentgeek.com)!
