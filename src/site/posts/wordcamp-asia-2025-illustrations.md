I've completed the WordCamp world tour with [WordCamp Asia 2025](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/)! I had a wonderful time in Manila, Philippines drawing avatars for attendees at the [WordPress.com](https://developer.wordpress.com) booth.

## Mall of Asia

The [Mall of Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM_Mall_of_Asia) was close to the conference and where I was staying, and I ended up walking to the mall several times. It's currently the sixth-largest mall in the world, at over 6 million square feet!

The shops and restaurants were interesting. I was surprised to see many American brand stores.

Or does drawing avatars, caricatures, and other custom illustrations sound like a fun way to engage your audience? I would absolutely love more opportunities to do this kind of work! [Let's talk](mailto:david@reverentgeek.com)!
