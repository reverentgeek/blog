There was a time when business cards were important for sharing contact information, as well as your brand. I was certainly very proud of the business cards I carried during my early career.

Years ago, inspired by a social media post, I created a "virtual card" for fun. If you have Node.js installed, you can run `npx reverentgeek` in your terminal or command prompt to get my latest "card."

If you're interested in creating your own, you can check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reverentgeek/reverentgeek-card). There are some basic instructions on how to customize the code to make your own card.

Lately, I've been using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and having a lot of fun coding again. I decided to try [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) to refactor my original virtual card. It's now much easier to update my card in the future. I haven't used Codex enough to form an opinion yet on which is better, but both Codex and Claude are extremely powerful tools.
