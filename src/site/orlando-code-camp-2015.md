March 28, 2015 I had the great pleasure of giving two talks at the 10th annual [Orlando Code Camp](http://orlandocodecamp.com/). This was my first Orlando Code Camp, and I was quite impressed.

[Esteban Garcia](https://twitter.com/EstebanFGarcia) and his team ran a tight ship. Over 800 attendees were signed up to attend this free, all-day Saturday event. [Seminole State College](https://www.seminolestate.edu/) was a perfect venue, allowing plenty of classrooms for 13 concurrent tracks in the same building. The speaker party and code camp after-party were both held at [Liam Fitzpatrick's](http://www.liamfitzpatricks.com/), a delicious Irish Pub.

My first talk of the day was "[Do you even Kanban?](https://speakerdeck.com/reverentgeek/do-you-even-kanban)" This talk was big milestone for me.

1. There was no code.
2. I wanted this talk to be motivational, not just teaching.
3. I drew every slide by hand.

The inspiration to use hand-drawn illustrations came from [Dan Roam's](http://www.danroam.com/) [talk at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1SMm4mOV9A) on his book "[Show and Tell](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Tell-Everybody-Extraordinary-Presentations/dp/1591846854/)." His approach to telling stories with simple, hand-drawn illustrations really struck a chord with me. I had so much fun coming up with the illustrations for my talk, to the point that I almost couldn't stop.

My second talk was an [Intro to Node.js](https://speakerdeck.com/reverentgeek/intro-to-node-dot-js-for-net-developers) for .NET developers. I think I was still a little too excited from giving the Kanban talk. I talked too much, and had to cut short my demos. Dagnabbit!

The feedback I received from both talks was positive and encouraging. My _sincere_ thanks to each of you that took time to share your thoughts and questions. Maybe I'm starting to get the hang of this public speaking thing after all!

I also found time to attend a few sessions, including [Brent Schooley](https://twitter.com/brentschooley)'s talk on Ember.js, and [Eric Nograles](https://twitter.com/grales)' talk on Sails.js. All were great! The personal connections made at events like these make all the time and effort worth it. I especially enjoyed getting to know [Andrew Kozlik](https://twitter.com/codefortravel) at the speaker dinner, and [Ralph](https://twitter.com/ralphwilliams) and Rob at the after party.

In all, my first Orlando Code Camp was nothing short of delightful. I hope to back again. Maybe next time I'll take the motorcycle!
