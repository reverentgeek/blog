<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I love to code, but I also spend a good bit of time writing. I write blog posts (like this one), tutorials, documentation, and a lot of notes. Chances are you also spend time writing, or need to do more of it. We all love documentation, right?</p>
<p>The hard part about writing is... writing. Tools should not add to that stress. I believe tools should get out of the way and let me get the job done. The simpler, the better.</p>
<p>Here's the short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use Markdown syntax</li>
<li>I write with <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/">MacDown</a> and <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a></li>
<li>I blog with <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a></li>
<li>I capture screen shots with <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html">Snagit</a> and video with <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a></li>
<li>I draw illustrations with <a href="http://www.adonit.net/forge/">Forge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A few years ago I discovered a beautiful, plain text markup language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. Markdown syntax is simple, easy to learn, and can be quickly turned into HTML, PDF or other formats. I find I can write notes, ideas, and drafts using any text editor at hand. And, there are many content applications that support Markdown syntax directly.</p>
<p>For short, quick documentation I usually write in whatever editor I'm currently using. There are Markdown plugins available for <a href="https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview">Atom</a>, <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Preview">Sublime Text</a>, and <a href="http://vswebessentials.com/">Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>For focused writing, my go-to editor at the moment is <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/">MacDown</a>. MacDown provides a live preview of my content rendered as HTML. I can customize the editing experience. And, I can export my content as HTML or PDF.</p>

<p>For <em>serious</em> writing, I launch the <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a> desktop application. Hemingway analyzes my text for readability and grammar, and offers suggestions for improvement. It's a great first-line defense for better blog posts, or before handing content over to a &quot;real&quot; professional.</p>

<h2 id="bloggingdoesnthavetobescary">Blogging doesn't have to be scary</h2>
<p>To restate, writing is hard enough without tools getting in the way. That is why I love using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> for my blog.</p>
<p>Ghost is easy to set up and manage. It supports Markdown, so I can copy and paste a draft I may have started elsewhere. Ghost renders a live preview while I write. Adding images to a blog post, which can be cumbersome with other blog platforms, couldn't be easier in Ghost.</p>
<p>How to add an image to a Ghost blog post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type an empty image markup tag: <code>![]()</code></li>
<li>An image placeholder appears in the live preview</li>
<li>Drag and drop an image to the placeholder</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="apictureisworthathousandwords">A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>
<p>Visuals such as pictures, illustrations, and video convey information and meaning elebenty-billion times faster than text alone. <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html">Snagit</a> and <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a> are indispensible tools for capturing screenshots and video. Both allow me to add highlights, arrows, and captions to screenshots.</p>

<p>For hand-drawn sketches and illustrations, I've been using <a href="http://www.adonit.net/forge/">Forge</a>. I especially like being able to create a new sketch based on selecting layers in an existing sketch. This allows me to quickly build a series of evolving illustrations.</p>
