You've probably seen the [ShamWow meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vince-shlomi-shamwow-slap-chop). You know, the classic, cheesy infomercial guy.

A couple of years ago, I had the idea of drawing that meme for one of my tech talks, as a transition to a demo.

I was so proud of it. And, it get a few chuckles from audiences.

I was recently going through my slides for an upcoming conference, and decided I'd try drawing that image again.

I don't know about you, but _I_ think it's an improvement.

Once I started drawing for my talks, I got hooked. It became one of my favorite hobbies.

For the past year, I've drawn _something_ almost every day. Usually no more than 10-15 minutes. You may have seen some of my silly stuff on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reverentgeek) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reverentgeek/).

I've determined that drawing is a skill, no different than any other skill. A new skill takes patience and practice.

Is there anything you wish you could do or become? Art? Photography? A musical instrument? Programming? Design? Public speaking?

What is holding you back?

Here's what you need: some determination, consistent incremental practice, and a whole lot of patience.

Unfortunately, as I've said in my talk, [Public Speaking without Barfing on Your Shoes](https://youtu.be/aPSvHT9USO8), there's no shortcut to success. But, if you keep on practicing, little by little, one day you might wake up and realize how far you've really come.

Do something that makes you happy. And, every chance you get, add a little more to it.

Get out there and be awesome!
