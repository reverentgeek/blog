Yep, that thing we keep saying is important and need to do, but never seem to find the time. Like blogging, learning a new language, losing weight, playing guitar, or any number of things we wish we could do.

I've heard [Cory House](https://twitter.com/housecor) say we just need to start. Somewhere. Any where. Pick any person that you admire. Yep, they had to start somewhere, too.

Speaking of Cory, have you seen his site [Outlier Developer](http://www.outlierdeveloper.com/)? The tag line is "Reboot your career." Go watch his "[Becoming an Outlier](https://vimeo.com/97415346)" talk from NDC Oslo 2014. Or, here's an [excellent summary](http://theburningmonk.com/2014/06/ndc-oslo-2014-takeaways-from-career-reboot-for-the-developer-mind/). Oh, and there's an entire [Pluralsight course](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/career-reboot-for-developer-mind), as well.

And, speaking of starting somewhere, go get yourself a copy of "[Start: Punch Fear in the Face](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters-ebook/dp/B00CHVIVMY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404999518&sr=8-1)" by [Jon Acuff](http://acuff.me/). While you're there, pick up this short read, "[Do the Work](http://www.amazon.com/Do-Work-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B004PGO25O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1404999903&sr=1-1)" by Steven Pressfield.

Get out there and punch some bears in the face.
