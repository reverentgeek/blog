I'm excited to announce that my "Introduction to RavenDB: NoSQL is Rapping at Your Door" presentation that I gave at [CodeMash 2012](http://codemash.org/) was recorded by InfoQ is [now available](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Introducing-RavenDB-NoSQL-is-Rapping-at-Your-Door).

This was my first year to CodeMash, and it was an absolute blast for me AND my family. Here are just two reasons to go next year: indoor water park and bacon bar. Need I say more? CodeMash 2012 sold out in just 20 minutes, so you better start getting ready for 2013.

I'll being giving a similar (but much improved) version of this talk at [CodepaLOUsa 2012](http://codepalousa.com/) in Louisville, KY, March 15-17. Hope to see you there!
