I'm excited to announce that I'm part of the blogger community [FreshBrewedCode.com](http://freshbrewedcode.com/). It's certainly an honor to be named among peers that I highly admire and respect. This blog will continue to be a mixed bag of geeky, personal, and philosophical, but you may notice that my more technical posts will be cross-posted to FreshBrewedCode. If you're so inclined, I believe FreshBrewedCode will be a site worth keeping your eye on.
