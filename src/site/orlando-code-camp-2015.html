<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>March 28, 2015 I had the great pleasure of giving two talks at the 10th annual <a href="http://orlandocodecamp.com/">Orlando Code Camp</a>. This was my first Orlando Code Camp, and I was quite impressed.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EstebanFGarcia">Esteban Garcia</a> and his team ran a tight ship. Over 800 attendees were signed up to attend this free, all-day Saturday event. <a href="https://www.seminolestate.edu/">Seminole State College</a> was a perfect venue, allowing plenty of classrooms for 13 concurrent tracks in the same building. The speaker party and code camp after-party were both held at <a href="http://www.liamfitzpatricks.com/">Liam Fitzpatrick's</a>, a delicious Irish Pub.</p>

<p>My first talk of the day was &quot;<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/reverentgeek/do-you-even-kanban">Do you even Kanban?</a>&quot; This talk was big milestone for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>There was no code.</li>
<li>I wanted this talk to be motivational, not just teaching.</li>
<li>I drew every slide by hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>The inspiration to use hand-drawn illustrations came from <a href="http://www.danroam.com/">Dan Roam's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1SMm4mOV9A">talk at Google</a> on his book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Show-Tell-Everybody-Extraordinary-Presentations/dp/1591846854/">Show and Tell</a>.&quot; His approach to telling stories with simple, hand-drawn illustrations really struck a chord with me. I had so much fun coming up with the illustrations for my talk, to the point that I almost couldn't stop.</p>

<p>My second talk was an <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/reverentgeek/intro-to-node-dot-js-for-net-developers">Intro to Node.js</a> for .NET developers. I think I was still a little too excited from giving the Kanban talk. I talked too much, and had to cut short my demos. Dagnabbit!</p>

<p>The feedback I received from both talks was positive and encouraging. My <em>sincere</em> thanks to each of you that took time to share your thoughts and questions. Maybe I'm starting to get the hang of this public speaking thing after all!</p>
<p>I also found time to attend a few sessions, including <a href="https://twitter.com/brentschooley">Brent Schooley</a>'s talk on Ember.js, and <a href="https://twitter.com/grales">Eric Nograles</a>' talk on Sails.js. All were great! The personal connections made at events like these make all the time and effort worth it. I especially enjoyed getting to know <a href="https://twitter.com/codefortravel">Andrew Kozlik</a> at the speaker dinner, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ralphwilliams">Ralph</a> and Rob at the after party.</p>
<p>In all, my first Orlando Code Camp was nothing short of delightful. I hope to back again. Maybe next time I'll take the motorcycle!</p>
