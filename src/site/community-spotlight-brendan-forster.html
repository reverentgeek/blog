<p><em>It is my pleasure to present this community tribute to Brendan Forster, written by guest author <a href="https://twitter.com/mordzuber">Mord Zuber</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I first met Brendan when I was looking for an open source project I could contribute to. At that point in the time, the only language I felt comfortable enough to contribute with was C#. I came across <a href="https://octokit.github.io/">octokit.net</a>, and started working on one of the open issues.</p>
<p>Brendanâ€™s happiness to help, and the length he will go to help a new contributor's pull request get merged, have served as a definitive guide on how to be an OSS maintainer.</p>

<p>I have immensely enjoyed Brendan's talks and the interactions I've had with him at conferences. Thank you, Brendan, for making an impact on the community!</p>
