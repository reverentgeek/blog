<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I am so honored that <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielGlenn">Daniel Glenn</a> reached out to me to design the logo for the <a href="http://www.spsevents.org/city/Nashville/Nashville2017">2017 Nashville SharePoint Saturday</a> event. Here is the final design we landed on:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/04/spsnashville-logo.png" alt="Nashville SharePoint Saturday"></p>
<p>Here is the logo printed on a shirt and a sticker, which were given to attendees of the event.</p>

<h3 id="illustrationtools">Illustration Tools</h3>
<p>I used an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil to create all the artwork. Most of the work was done in my favorite sketching app, <a href="http://www.tayasui.com/sketches/">Sketches Pro</a>. I created the final guitar illustration using <a href="https://concepts.tophatch.com/">Concepts</a>, then imported it back into Sketches Pro to put it all together.</p>
