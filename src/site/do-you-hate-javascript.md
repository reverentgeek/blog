If you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reverentgeek) you know that I poke fun at JavaScript quite a bit. Someone recently asked me,

> "Do you hate JavaScript?"

No! I genuinely enjoy using JavaScript to build applications.

## But, I like a good laugh.

Every programming language I know has its own challenges and peculiarities. JavaScript has a reputation for being exceptionally quirky. And, at times, a bit frustrating and confusing.

Since I use JavaScript a lot, I'm qualified to poke fun at its warts. It would _not_ be cool for me to poke fun at other languages I don't know.

In reality, the JavaScript language itself has gotten _much_ better since ES2015 (ES6). It's a joy to work with. The struggles we face today have more to do with challenges beyond the language. Things like the explosion of libraries to choose from, complexity of frameworks, packaging and build tools, and supporting older browsers.

## There's a JavaScript for that.

There's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer.

[Atwood's Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/) states:

> Any application that _can_ be written in JavaScript, _will_ eventually be written in JavaScript.

This is true now more than ever. You can build web sites with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), or one of \[insert very large number\] of frameworks. You can build mobile apps with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Sencha](https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [NativeScript](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript), or [tabris.js](https://tabrisjs.com/). You can build desktop apps with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) or [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/). You can build robots with [Johnny Five](https://www.sparkfun.com/j5ik) or [Cylon.js](https://cylonjs.com/).

## Want to learn more about JavaScript?

Know nothing about programming? JavaScript is a great place to start!

Use JavaScript every day? There's always more to learn! That's why I love being a programmer!

### Get some tools.

Here are a few tools you might want to have nearby.

1. Open the JavaScript Console in your favorite browser: [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console), Safari. Modern web browsers have excellent developer tools built-in.
2. Get yourself a good editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is currently my favorite for JavaScript. It's free. It works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Debugging is top notch. And, it keeps getting better and better.
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Not only is it a great way to play with JavaScript, you get [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which is an essential tool for installing other JS utilities and frameworks.
4. Use npm to install [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server). This is a great little web server you can use play with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It monitors your files, and immediately refreshes your browser with the latest changes.

Next, check out some learning material. This is _not_ an exhaustive list. If you have a favorite, please suggest it in the comments!
