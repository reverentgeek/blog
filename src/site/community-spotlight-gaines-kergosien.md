In my opinion, Gaines is a community hero. He's not only been involved in the Nashville software development community, he's also been a volunteer firefighter since 2013. Beginning in 2008, he has faithfully served the [Nashville .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Nashville-NET-User-Group/) in every type of role, always eager to help in any way that he can.

## Music City Code

I remember many years ago, Gaines talking about wanting to create a first-class developer conference in Nashville. In 2015, I witnessed his vision become a reality in [Music City Code](https://www.musiccitycode.com/). 2015 and 2016 were awesome, and 2017 will no doubt be even better!

Thank you, Gaines, for all the work you do to serve others!
