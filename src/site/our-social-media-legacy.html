<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Something I've been thinking about recently is the long-term impact that social media will have on society. Good or bad, everything we post on Facebook, Twitter, blogs, or other social media becomes permanent public record. What impact will the content we publish today have on our lives 10, 20, or 30 years from now? What about after we are gone?</p>
<h2>What if my Dad had Twitter?</h2>
My Dad passed away from cancer when I was 21. I have some good memories of my Dad, but I can count on one hand the number of conversations we had the last 5 years of his life. I never got to know my Dad in my adult years. Being similar in many ways, I'm certain he could have given me insight into family, career, and personal struggles. At the very least, he could have shared with me what wisdom he'd gained from his own personal failures.
<p>The thought occurred to me, <em>&quot;What if social media had been around in my Dad's lifetime?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Without a doubt, I would find and read every post, tweet, or message I could get my virtual hands on. I would want every possible clue as to what he was like, and what made him tick. And, in knowing him, perhaps I would better know myself.</p>
<p>In light of that realization, should I be taking social media more seriously?</p>
<h2>Leaving a Virtual Legacy</h2>
I've not always succeeded, but I try to conduct myself online in a responsible way. I understand that anyone could be watching and reading. What legacy am I leaving my children and future generations?
<p>What legacy are you leaving?</p>
