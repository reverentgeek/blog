Earlier this month I had the incredible privilege of speaking at [NDC Sydney](http://ndcsydney.com/)! Australia has been at the top of my most-wanted-to-visit places since I was young. I can't begin to tell you how excited I was to have this opportunity!

## The jet lag, it is real

Yes. Very. The flight from San Francisco to Sydney is about 15 hours, and you lose about another day due to the time difference!

## Part 1: Vacation

We flew into Sydney about a week ahead of the conference so we could enjoy some of the sights and culture.

We took a day-long group tour to the Blue Mountains, which was the highlight of our vacation.

## Part 2: The Conference

NDC Conferences are a well-oiled software developer conference machine. They have conferences in [Oslo Norway](http://ndcoslo.com/), [London UK](http://ndc-london.com/), and now [Sydney Australia](http://ndcsydney.com/). Every event I have been to has been consistently awesome. They have a very professional staff, a fantastic A/V crew, and the best food.

NDC record all of their sessions, and make them available soon after each event. Go check out their [invaluable library of speaker recordings](https://vimeo.com/ndcconferences)!

I gave a refreshed version of my Node.js Crash Course (for .NET developers), including a bunch of new [hand-drawn illustrations](https://medium.com/@reverentgeek/captivate-your-audience-using-simple-illustrations-5bf0fcd0e301#.reirgq1nc) for the audience to enjoy.

## Bonus Round!

While in Sydney, I saw a retweet from [Rod Vagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg):

> Looking for a speaker for Thursday's [#nodejs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nodejs?src=hash) meetup in Sydney! Ping me if you'd like to talk about your Node adventures, favourite lib, etc

I reached out to the organizer, and ended up giving my Electron talk to the [Sydney Node Ninjas](http://www.meetup.com/sydney-node-ninjas/events/228199767/?from=ref) meetup! They were a great audience, asked _lots_ of questions, and even laughed at my jokes! Or, maybe they were just laughing at my redneck English... ;)

## A++++ would travel again

I had an amazing time. I will definitely do it again, if I ever get the opportunity. My only regret is not having more time to explore more of Australia outside of Sydney.
