<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Year after year, CodeStock continues to expand, improve, and win a special place in my heart. As with any conference, the hallway conversations and opportunity to get to meet amazing people is every bit as valuable as the sessions.</p>
<h2 id="theroadtocodestockispavedwithawesome">The road to CodeStock is paved with awesome</h2>
<p>One of the reasons I love CodeStock is simply getting there. It gives me an opportunity to ride some of the most beautiful roads in the country.</p>
<p>This year I decided to share the experience, and offered to have others join me for a <a href="/ride-with-reverentgeek-codestock-2016/">Ride with ReverentGeek</a>. My hope is this will be a growing annual event! All are welcome to join, including &quot;cagers&quot; (what motorcycle enthusiasts call people who drive cars  ðŸ˜‰).</p>

<h2 id="theconference">The conference</h2>
<p>This year, <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor">Cory House</a> returned for the opening keynote. And, wow, what a keynote it was!</p>
<p>Cory provided clear and compelling evidence of the pros and cons for everyone on the technology adoption curve: early adopters, mainstream, and tech laggards. Wherever we find ourselves on the curve, he provided tips and encouragement to &quot;own&quot; our career and take full advantage of the opportunities. He almost convinced me to be a COBOL developer!</p>

<h2 id="mytalks">My talks</h2>
<p>I had a great turnout for my &quot;Taking Back Project Sanity: The Kanban Journey&quot; and &quot;Cross-Platform Desktop Apps with Electron.&quot; I so much appreciate the feedback and conversations I had after the talks!</p>

<p>I continue to receive a lot of comments on my use of hand-drawn illustrations in my slides.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Man, <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek">@reverentgeek</a>&#39;s hand drawn slides are so fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeStock2016?src=hash">#CodeStock2016</a> <a href="https://t.co/vmECkazdVA">pic.twitter.com/vmECkazdVA</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Hayes (@RyannosaurusRex) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyannosaurusRex/status/754331681872576512">July 16, 2016</a></blockquote>
