<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Each year for the last several years, I have ridden my motorcycle to <a href="http://www.codestock.org/">CodeStock</a> in Knoxville, TN. Not very far from Knoxville is some of the most beautiful, scenic roads in the entire USA.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2016/07/IMG_4434.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>My favorite is the <a href="http://cherohala.org/">Cherohala Skyway</a>. The Cherohala Skyway reaches over 5,400 feet elevation with amazing views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Highway 129, known world-wide by motorcyle and car enthusiasts as &quot;<a href="http://tailofthedragon.com/">The Tail of the Dragon</a>&quot;, is a rollercoaster ride of 318 curves in just 11 miles. I look forward to this trip all year. What would make the trip even better is to share the experience with <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>If you've ever followed one of the old Tech*Ed conferences or a Microsoft MVP Summit, you may have heard about an unofficial event &quot;Party with Palermo.&quot; For many years, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffreypalermo">Jeffrey Palermo</a> has put together a great gathering of geeks, to socialize and have fun.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from &quot;Party with Palermo,&quot; I've come up with my own event: &quot;<strong>Ride with ReverentGeek</strong>.&quot; If you're keen to see some of the most beautiful sights in all creation, I would love for you to join me in riding/driving from Tellico Plains, TN to Knoxville, TN, taking in the Cherohala Skyway and &quot;The Tail of the Dragon&quot; along the way.</p>
