<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yep, that thing we keep saying is important and need to do, but never seem to find the time. Like blogging, learning a new language, losing weight, playing guitar, or any number of things we wish we could do.</p>
<p>I've heard <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor">Cory House</a> say we just need to start. Somewhere. Any where. Pick any person that you admire. Yep, they had to start somewhere, too.</p>
<p>Speaking of Cory, have you seen his site <a href="http://www.outlierdeveloper.com/">Outlier Developer</a>? The tag line is &quot;Reboot your career.&quot; Go watch his &quot;<a href="https://vimeo.com/97415346">Becoming an Outlier</a>&quot; talk from NDC Oslo 2014. Or, here's an <a href="http://theburningmonk.com/2014/06/ndc-oslo-2014-takeaways-from-career-reboot-for-the-developer-mind/">excellent summary</a>. Oh, and there's an entire <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/career-reboot-for-developer-mind">Pluralsight course</a>, as well.</p>
<p>And, speaking of starting somewhere, go get yourself a copy of &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters-ebook/dp/B00CHVIVMY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404999518&amp;sr=8-1">Start: Punch Fear in the Face</a>&quot; by <a href="http://acuff.me/">Jon Acuff</a>. While you're there, pick up this short read, &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Do-Work-Steven-Pressfield-ebook/dp/B004PGO25O/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404999903&amp;sr=1-1">Do the Work</a>&quot; by Steven Pressfield.</p>
<p>Get out there and punch some bears in the face.</p>
