There are many life events when people are paid tribute. Job changes. Relocations. Tragedies. Deaths.

Without a doubt, honoring people at these times is touching and needed.

I’m starting to question, “Why don’t we voice our appreciation, at least more often, _before_ these significant events happen?”

The more I think about it, the more I want to honor and encourage the people who have impacted my life and career.

**Now.**

I believe communicating our appreciation has the potential for profound and far-reaching effects. Our positive words and actions may be invaluable gifts that others cherish.

Here’s a secret. Being grateful and honoring others is a vicious cycle. The more you give, the more you receive.

### Think of someone who is awesome.

Maybe that person is going through a really tough time. Maybe they are struggling with motivation, apathy, or depression. Maybe they could really use an encouraging word from you.

Tell them.

**Don’t wait.**
