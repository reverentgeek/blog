<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>On the morning of November 25, 1982, we all piled in our car and made the 2-hour trip to my Aunt and Uncle’s house near Atlanta, GA. It’s Thanksgiving. As was tradition on my mother’s side of the family, we joined hands, gave thanks for our blessings, and enjoyed a meal together.</p>
<p>This particularly momentous Thanksgiving Day, I discovered the TRS-80.</p>

<p>I don’t remember if I spent the <em>entire</em> day at that keyboard. What I do know is, I must have made an impression on my Uncle.</p>
<h3 id="anamazingactofkindness">An amazing act of kindness</h3>
<p>Some time after that Thanksgiving, we made another trip to my Aunt and Uncle’s house. Waiting for me there was a big cardboard box. Inside was the TRS-80, a cassette drive, a floppy drive, a dot matrix printer, cables, and a book titled, “Getting Started With Color BASIC.”</p>

<p>This one very kind and generous act launched me on a journey of computers and programming. I am forever grateful, and in their debt, for helping me to discover something that has not only been my career, but a source of learning, passion, and delight.</p>

<p>I can’t thank my Aunt and Uncle enough for the impact they have made in my life. I continue to be inspired by their example of investing not only in their family, but the lives of countless others.</p>
<p>Thank you, to all of you who are making an impact, and all of you who <em>will</em> make an impact, in your families and communities.</p>
