I recently switched to using [Blazon](https://presentboldly.com/) for all my presentations, and I couldn't be happier. Here are some of my favorite features:

* Markdown
* Code block syntax highlighting
* Shared code blocks
* Line-by-line highlighting
* Offline viewing

## Effortless editing with markdown

[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a plain-text formatting syntax that gets converted to HTML. The rules are simple and easy to pick up.  
As you type content for a slide, Blazon gives you a live preview of how that content is presented on a slide.

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting makes code easier to read, and it's something that developers can appreciate.

## Shared code blocks

Need to walk through a lot of code across multiple slides? Blazon let's you create and reference shared files. You can even select which lines from a file you want to appear on a slide. Make a change to a file, and all the slides that make use of that file are automatically updated. Boom.

## Highlight specific lines of code

Blazon takes shared code files a step further by allowing you to highlight specific lines of code. This is a _killer_ way to walk through your code.

## No WiFi? No problem.

Blazon allows you to download your entire presentation as a self-contained web page with all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you need. It even downloads all your silly images and animated gifs.

> _Pro tip:_ Your argument is 189.3% more valid when using animated gifs.

## Pro features coming soon

Currently in beta, there are a number of features coming to Blazon that make it _the_ tool for speakers and training professionals.

* **Remote Control:** Start a presentation and drive it with your phone or tablet. Your speaker notes appear also appear on your device!
* **Audience Follow Along:** Give your audience a URL they can use to follow along with your presentation. They can go back and view previous slides, but they can't jump ahead of you!

## No-Brainer

Blazon is destined to become the best tool for technical presentations and training. Don't waste any more time coercing PowerPoint or Keynote.
