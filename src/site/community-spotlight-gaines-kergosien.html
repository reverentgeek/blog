<p>In my opinion, Gaines is a community hero. He's not only been involved in the Nashville software development community, he's also been a volunteer firefighter since 2013. Beginning in 2008, he has faithfully served the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Nashville-NET-User-Group/">Nashville .NET User Group</a> in every type of role, always eager to help in any way that he can.</p>

<p>I remember many years ago, Gaines talking about wanting to create a first-class developer conference in Nashville. In 2015, I witnessed his vision become a reality in <a href="https://www.musiccitycode.com/">Music City Code</a>. 2015 and 2016 were awesome, and 2017 will no doubt be even better!</p>
<p>Thank you, Gaines, for all the work you do to serve others!</p>
