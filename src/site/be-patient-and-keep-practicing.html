<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>You've probably seen the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vince-shlomi-shamwow-slap-chop">ShamWow meme</a>. You know, the classic, cheesy infomercial guy.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I had the idea of drawing that meme for one of my tech talks, as a transition to a demo.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/09/demo.jpg" alt="Demo version 1"></p>
<p>I was so proud of it. And, it get a few chuckles from audiences.</p>
<p>I was recently going through my slides for an upcoming conference, and decided I'd try drawing that image again.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/09/shamwow-guy-demo.jpg" alt="Demo version 2"></p>
<p>I don't know about you, but <em>I</em> think it's an improvement.</p>
<p>Once I started drawing for my talks, I got hooked. It became one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
<p>For the past year, I've drawn <em>something</em> almost every day. Usually no more than 10-15 minutes. You may have seen some of my silly stuff on <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reverentgeek/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>I've determined that drawing is a skill, no different than any other skill. A new skill takes patience and practice.</p>
<p>Is there anything you wish you could do or become? Art? Photography? A musical instrument? Programming? Design? Public speaking?</p>
<p>What is holding you back?</p>
<p>Here's what you need: some determination, consistent incremental practice, and a whole lot of patience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as I've said in my talk, <a href="https://youtu.be/aPSvHT9USO8">Public Speaking without Barfing on Your Shoes</a>, there's no shortcut to success. But, if you keep on practicing, little by little, one day you might wake up and realize how far you've really come.</p>
<p>Do something that makes you happy. And, every chance you get, add a little more to it.</p>
<p>Get out there and be awesome!</p>
