**Being "good enough" is not good enough.**

Switchfoot recently released an album named _[Vice Verses](http://www.amazon.com/Vice-Verses/dp/B005MW5G1E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1320233645&sr=8-1 "Vice Verses")_ that has struck a chord with my life (pardon the pun). Here's the chorus from one of the album's songs.

> No, I'm not alright I know that I'm not right A steering wheel doesn't mean you can drive A warm body doesn't mean I'm alive
>
> No, I'm not alright  
> I know that I'm not right  
> Feel like I travel but I never arrive  
> I wanna thrive not just survive
>
> \-- Switchfoot, Thrive

There's a scene in the movie _[Courageous](http://www.courageousthemovie.com/)_ where one character says, "You've been a good enough father." To which the second replies, "I don't want to be a 'good enough' father." Later, that same character says,

> "I don't feel like I started well. I want to finish well."

There are many areas of my life where I don't want to settle for "good enough."

* I don't want to be a "good enough" husband.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" father.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" friend.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" boss.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" employee.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" software developer.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" musician.
* I don't want to be a "good enough" mentor.
* I want to thrive, not just survive.

I believe there's no such thing as standing still. You're either pushing yourself forward, or you're drifting backwards.
