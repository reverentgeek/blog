![Jeremy Clark](/content/images/2017/05/jeremy-clark.png)

Self-titled "Developer Betterer," [Jeremy Clark's](https://twitter.com/jeremybytes) personal mission is to help developers. This passion manifests itself it many ways. He has an excellent set of courses he's created for [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/jeremy-clark), speaks at conferences all over the place, and regularly blogs about things he's learning at [jeremybytes.com](http://www.jeremybytes.com/).

But, it doesn't stop at technical skills. Jeremy is also doing incredible work to help developers advance their careers, and how they relate to one another. His talk, "Becoming A Social Developer" is making a big impact. Watch it here:

Jeremy, thank you for all you're doing in the developer community! You are awesome, and you make people's lives brighter everywhere you go. I am grateful to call you "friend."

### Are you a better developer because of Jeremy?
