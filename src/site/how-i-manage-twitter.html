<p>I keep the people I follow to around 256. That's a good, nerdy number for me. And, it's still manageable to keep up with all the tweets in this group, most of the time.</p>
<p>I use Twitter <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460">lists</a> to categorize other accounts I want to follow.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/">Tweetbot for macOS</a> with columns for my main timeline and the lists that I watch. I believe you can configure <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> to do something similar.</p>
<p>How I configure my columns in Tweetbot:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ~256 accounts I follow</li>
<li>A short, private list of folks who I absolutely don't want to miss any of their tweets. There is some overlap with the accounts I follow.</li>
<li>A list of the people I work with.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek/lists/tech-community">Tech Community</a> list of people of influence in software/tech industry.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek/lists/tech-events">Tech Events</a> list of conferences and events. This helps me watch for announcements, such as a &quot;Call for Papers&quot; (CFP).</li>
</ul>

<p>If I get too far behind, it's okay to declare &quot;Twitter bankruptcy&quot; on any of these columns except my private list.</p>
<p>I like that Tweetbot for macOS and <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot for iOS</a> stay in sync.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14606">Direct messages</a> are enabled for everyone, so anyone I'm not following can still message me.</p>
<p>I have notifications for &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;retweets&quot; turned off. Occasionally I'll visit <a href="https://twitter.com/i/notifications">https://twitter.com/i/notifications</a> or the same view in the Twitter iOS app to see an aggregate view of likes and retweets.</p>
<p>Do you have any tips or strategies you'd like to share on managing Twitter content?</p>
