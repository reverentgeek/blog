<p>There are many life events when people are paid tribute. Job changes. Relocations. Tragedies. Deaths.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, honoring people at these times is touching and needed.</p>
<p>I’m starting to question, “Why don’t we voice our appreciation, at least more often, <em>before</em> these significant events happen?”</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I want to honor and encourage the people who have impacted my life and career.</p>
<p><strong>Now.</strong></p>
<p>I believe communicating our appreciation has the potential for profound and far-reaching effects. Our positive words and actions may be invaluable gifts that others cherish.</p>
<p>Here’s a secret. Being grateful and honoring others is a vicious cycle. The more you give, the more you receive.</p>
<h3 id="thinkofsomeonewhoisawesome">Think of someone who is awesome.</h3>
<p>Maybe that person is going through a really tough time. Maybe they are struggling with motivation, apathy, or depression. Maybe they could really use an encouraging word from you.</p>
<p>Tell them.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t wait.</strong></p>
