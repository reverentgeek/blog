<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Early in my career, I worked under a manager who exemplified the Dilbert Principle:</p>
<p><em>“The most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage: management.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I really didn’t like the man, personally or professionally. His incompetence was legendary. Mistakes were named after him.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/07/you-really-pulled-a-bob.jpg" alt="You really pulled a Bob, didn't you?"></p>
<p>(Name changed to protect the not-so-innocent.)</p>
<p>And, yet, he still continued to rise in rank and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Most of the work I was required to do under his direction was of no value to anyone. Case in point: I had to create a huge binder of documentation for every method and every stored procedure in the code we were writing.</p>

<p>No one was going to read this. Ever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meaningless and pointless work is soul crushing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I toughed it out for more than a year. I tried to find ways to get out from under him. With no hope of relief in sight, I found another job.</p>
<p>I said to myself, “Life is too short to work somewhere that stinks.”</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/07/life-is-too-short-stinks-1.jpg" alt="Life is too short to work somewhere that stinks"></p>
<p>I started living by this philosophy. I offered it as advice to many others, when I heard them complaining about their jobs.</p>
<p>In technology, we are very privileged we are in such high-demand, and we have the luxury of being able to choose where we work. That isn’t the case in every profession.</p>
<p>The problem is, this idea began to pollute my perspective. When things started going sour, I would think, “Oh, great. Here we go again. Time to start looking for a new job.”</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/07/life-is-too-short-stinks-2.jpg" alt="my polluted thinking"></p>
<p>Years later, I was in a similar situation. I was unhappy. I started interviewing at other companies. There was an attractive job offer on the table, and I was trying to decide if I should accept.</p>
<p>That’s when my wife asked me two questions that stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/07/have-you-done-everything.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you done everything you can do? If you left now, would you have any regrets?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I declined the job offer. I took ownership of the situation. I committed to doing everything I could to make my team successful.</p>
<p>In the end, I still left that job one year later. But, I left having no regrets, and proud of the work we had accomplished. It had been one of the most productive and prolific years of my career.</p>
<p>Sure, there can be toxic environments, career limiting situations, and amazing opportunities that come along where changing jobs is justified. For everything else, I’ve adopted a new mindset:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2017/07/life-is-too-short-to-let-things-stay-the-way-they-are.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is too short to stand by and let things stay the way they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've all heard the phrase, &quot;That’s not my job.&quot;</p>
<p>I’ve learned taking ownership and responsibility is <em>always</em> the right thing to do. And, it as far reaching effects.</p>
<p>I’ve learned it’s okay to be honest with your manager, or other leadership in your company. Ask yourself, and others around you,</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</p>
<p>You can be the catalyst that changes the ship's course, one degree at a time.</p>
