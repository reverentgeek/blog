<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgiard">David Giard</a>, the hardest working man in developer relations! Like Visa, he is everywhere you want to be.</p>
<p>David is not only one of my speaker heroes, he is a mentor and inspiration. Every encounter with David I've walked away feeling blessed. His positive attitude overflows into everything he does. I especially appreciate his daily goal of sharing at least one thing he is grateful for.</p>
<p>Here's a small example:</p>
