<p>It's my privilege to know Jim Holmes. He's one of my heroes. I owe Jim many, many thanks for the positive impact he's made on my career and personal life.</p>
<p>I first met Jim when we worked at Telligent, around 2008. He took on the monumental task of software quality and testing. Not only did he make a huge difference to the product, he left a significant mark on everyone in the company with his infectious passion, dedication, and snarky get-off-my-lawn-no-bull attitude.</p>

<p>Maybe you've heard about this little conference named <a href="http://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash</a>? Held at an indoor water park in the winter? Tickets sell out in minutes?</p>
<p>The genius behind it: Jim Holmes.</p>
<p>Jim handed over the reigns some time ago, but his legacy is cemented in creating one of the best software developer conferences. Ever. Countless developers <em>and</em> their families have benefited.</p>
<h3 id="atruemvp">A True MVP</h3>
<p>Jim fights tirelessly for just and noble causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bacon</li>
<li>Software Quality &amp; Automated Testing</li>
<li>Project Management</li>
<li>Opposing the use of the phrase &quot;best practices&quot;</li>
<li>Abolishing SharePoint</li>
<li>Tabs vs. Spaces</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="untilnexttime">Until next time...</h3>
<p>Jim, I don't know when our paths will cross again, but I'm looking forward to it including bacon, guitars, and lots of laughs.</p>
