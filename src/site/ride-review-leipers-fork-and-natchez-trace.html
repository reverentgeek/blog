<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I've been in Franklin, TN this week for meetings at <a href="http://leankit.com">LeanKit</a>. I made the decision to stay through the weekend before heading off to <a href="http://codepalousa.com/">Code PaLOUsa</a> in Louisville, KY.</p>
<p>It's Saturday, and I wake up this morning to much better weather than expected. Over breakfast at the Cracker Barrel off Highway 96 and I-65, I decide to take advantage of this weather with a ride in the area.</p>
<h2 id="franklinmainstreetfestival">Franklin Main Street Festival</h2>
<p>My original plan is to drive straight through Franklin. To my surprise, downtown Franklin is blocked off for the <a href="http://historicfranklin.com/events/event/main-street-festival/">Main Street Festival</a>. I decide to park the bike for a bit, and check out what the buzz is all about.</p>

<h2 id="leipersfork">Leiper's Fork</h2>
<p>After buying some cheese and a bow tie, I get back on the road. I take West Main Street out of Franklin, turn right on Southall Road, and follow signs to Leiper's Fork, TN. <a href="http://www.puckettsofleipersfork.com/">Puckett's Grocery</a> looks so inviting, I have to stop. Puckett's Grocery is a traditional Southern &quot;meat-n-three,&quot; but I persuade them to give me three meats and 2 vegetables instead. It is all delicious.</p>

<h2 id="oldstatehighway96">Old State Highway 96</h2>
<p>After filling my belly at Puckett's, I take the next right on to Old State Highway 96. What a beautiful stretch of road! The topographical map showed this road going through wooded hills, and the scenery did not disappoint. The road itself was a but rough in areas, though. Loose gravel and poorly patched sections of road are frustrating, but I still enjoy the view immensely.</p>
<p>Running into Highway 96, I turn left. Where Highway 96 meets Highway 100, I turn right and drive to the famous <a href="http://www.lovelesscafe.com/">Loveless Cafe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="natcheztraceparkway">Natchez Trace Parkway</h2>
<p>Less than a mile from the Loveless Cafe is the start of the 444-mile scenic <a href="http://www.nps.gov/natr/index.htm">Natchez Trace Parkway</a>. The Natchez Trace is a quiet, scenic road with gentle curves and breathtaking views. I make a few stops for pictures along the way. I wish I could ride more, but I jump off the parkway where it intersects Highway 46 near Leiper's Fork and retrace my steps back to Franklin.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The destinations are great. Old Highway 96 and Natchez Trace Parkway are two more cases where I wish I had a GoPro or similar video camera. These roads must be seen on two wheels, or at least with the top down!</p>
