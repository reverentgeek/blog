<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <a href="http://www.kcdc.info/">KCDC</a> is awesome. If you're a developer, you should go. If you're a speaker, you should speak.</p>
<p>I've spoken at a lot of conferences over the years. Very few have impressed me the way KCDC 2017 has. Everything about KCDC was above and beyond my expectations: hospitality, food, speakers, content, the venue, the hotel, proximity to good restaurants and coffee, and I could go on and on...</p>
<p>BUT DAT BBQ THO</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The burnt ends at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/kcdc2017?src=hash">#kcdc2017</a> are off the chain. I can&#39;t believe this is conference food. <a href="https://t.co/PQ6vQkEqIy">pic.twitter.com/PQ6vQkEqIy</a></p>&mdash; David Neal (@reverentgeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek/status/893512235926114304">August 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>As great as the food was, and as great as the sessions were, I have to say I was sincerely touched by how well I was treated by everyone.</p>
<p>Kansas City, you truly have some very special people, starting with the organizers of KCDC. Every conference has passionate organizers who want the best experience for their speakers and attendees. Somehow, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanfmills">Jon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/leebrandt">Lee</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffreystrauss">Jeff</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boontlee/">Boon</a> are on another level.</p>
<p>And, a very special thanks to other speakers, developers, and friends in the Kansas City area who are proud to call KC your home. You made me feel so welcome and appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being one of the biggest highlights of my 2017. I hope to see you all again soon.</p>
