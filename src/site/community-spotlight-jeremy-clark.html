<p>Self-titled &quot;Developer Betterer,&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremybytes">Jeremy Clark's</a> personal mission is to help developers. This passion manifests itself it many ways. He has an excellent set of courses he's created for <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/jeremy-clark">Pluralsight</a>, speaks at conferences all over the place, and regularly blogs about things he's learning at <a href="http://www.jeremybytes.com/">jeremybytes.com</a>.</p>
<p>But, it doesn't stop at technical skills. Jeremy is also doing incredible work to help developers advance their careers, and how they relate to one another. His talk, &quot;Becoming A Social Developer&quot; is making a big impact. Watch it here:</p>
