<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Oh Great Cloud,</p>
<p>Grant me the courage to write the code I can,<br>
to escalate the tickets I cannot fix,<br>
and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
<p>Programming one day at a time,<br>
enjoying one function at a time;<br>
accepting bugs as a pathway to code complete;<br>
taking this terrible codebase as it is;<br>
not as I would have it;<br>
trusting that all things will be made right<br>
if I surrender to writing tests and documentation;<br>
so that I may be reasonably happy at the end of the day<br>
and somewhat sane at the end of this release.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
