<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>CodeStock's theme this year was &quot;Making Connections,&quot; and there were plenty of opportunities for attendees to get connected. Connected to the latest technologies, and other professionals. The 2014 logo also carried this theme.</p>

<p>Similar to the way CodeStock opens up speaker submissions for voting, logos were submitted and voted on by the community. The winning design came from <a href="https://twitter.com/Lyshastra">Snowflake Allen</a> at <a href="http://snowzillaarts.com/">Snowzilla Arts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="apresentersnightmare">A presenter's nightmare</h2>
<p>CodeStock tried something different this year by having the keynote at the Knoxville Convention Center Auditorium, a short walk away. It was a nice venue that allowed them to host an attendee party. Less than 30 minutes from kickoff, I see this tweet from the keynote presenter:</p>

<p>I learned later the last-minute heroics to get <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor">Cory House</a> a working computer with his presentation <em>AND</em> the correct font installed. I would have been a basket case by the time I got on stage. But, it didn't seem to faze Cory.</p>
<p>Oh, but the fun didn't stop there.</p>
<p>The projector went out... not once... not twice... but, <em>three times</em>. Cory laughed right along with the audience and kept on trucking.</p>

<p>And, what an inspiring and memorable talk it was! As I mentioned in my <a href="http://reverentgeek.com/start-doing/">previous post</a>, you ought to check out Cory's &quot;<a href="https://vimeo.com/97415346">Becoming an Outlier</a>&quot; NDC recording and <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/career-reboot-for-developer-mind">Pluralsight course</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lightningtalks">Lightning talks</h2>
<p>Another experiment at CodeStock this year was replacing Open Spaces with a track of Lightning Talks. These talks were 15-20 minutes long, and scheduled throughout both days. I volunteered to give a lightning talk on running effective meetings using <a href="http://leancoffee.org/">Lean Coffee</a>. The format was casual, engaging, and interactive. Based on my experience and the feedback I heard from others, I would say the experiment was a great success. I'll definitely be participating in more of these in the future.</p>

<p>The biggest highlight of the conference for me was the journey itself. I took advantage of CodeStock's location by checking off two of the most beautiful and thrilling highways in America: the <a href="http://cherohala.org/">Cherohala Skyway</a> and Deal's Gap on highway 129. The Cherohala Skyway is nearly 50 miles long and reaches elevations over 5,400 feet. Deal's Gap is affectionately known as &quot;<a href="http://www.tailofthedragon.com/">The Tail of the Dragon</a>,&quot; or simply, the &quot;Dragon.&quot; The Dragon is only 11 miles long, but features a mind-boggling 318 curves!</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself near this area of TN and NC, you <em>must</em> experience these highways for yourself. Any vehicle will do, but I highly recommend a motorcycle or convertible ;-)</p>
