<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I recently switched to using <a href="https://presentboldly.com/">Blazon</a> for all my presentations, and I couldn't be happier. Here are some of my favorite features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>Code block syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Shared code blocks</li>
<li>Line-by-line highlighting</li>
<li>Offline viewing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effortlesseditingwithmarkdown">Effortless editing with markdown</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> is a plain-text formatting syntax that gets converted to HTML. The rules are simple and easy to pick up.<br>
As you type content for a slide, Blazon gives you a live preview of how that content is presented on a slide.</p>

<h2 id="syntaxhighlighting">Syntax highlighting</h2>
<p>Syntax highlighting makes code easier to read, and it's something that developers can appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="sharedcodeblocks">Shared code blocks</h2>
<p>Need to walk through a lot of code across multiple slides? Blazon let's you create and reference shared files. You can even select which lines from a file you want to appear on a slide. Make a change to a file, and all the slides that make use of that file are automatically updated. Boom.</p>

<h2 id="highlightspecificlinesofcode">Highlight specific lines of code</h2>
<p>Blazon takes shared code files a step further by allowing you to highlight specific lines of code. This is a <em>killer</em> way to walk through your code.</p>

<h2 id="nowifinoproblem">No WiFi? No problem.</h2>
<p>Blazon allows you to download your entire presentation as a self-contained web page with all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you need. It even downloads all your silly images and animated gifs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pro tip:</em> Your argument is 189.3% more valid when using animated gifs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="profeaturescomingsoon">Pro features coming soon</h2>
<p>Currently in beta, there are a number of features coming to Blazon that make it <em>the</em> tool for speakers and training professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote Control:</strong> Start a presentation and drive it with your phone or tablet. Your speaker notes appear also appear on your device!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audience Follow Along:</strong> Give your audience a URL they can use to follow along with your presentation. They can go back and view previous slides, but they can't jump ahead of you!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nobrainer">No-Brainer</h2>
<p>Blazon is destined to become the best tool for technical presentations and training. Don't waste any more time coercing PowerPoint or Keynote.</p>
