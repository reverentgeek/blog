<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Earlier this month I had the incredible privilege of speaking at <a href="http://ndcsydney.com/">NDC Sydney</a>! Australia has been at the top of my most-wanted-to-visit places since I was young. I can't begin to tell you how excited I was to have this opportunity!</p>
<h2 id="thejetlagitisreal">The jet lag, it is real</h2>
<p>Yes. Very. The flight from San Francisco to Sydney is about 15 hours, and you lose about another day due to the time difference!</p>
<h2 id="part1vacation">Part 1: Vacation</h2>
<p>We flew into Sydney about a week ahead of the conference so we could enjoy some of the sights and culture.</p>

<p>We took a day-long group tour to the Blue Mountains, which was the highlight of our vacation.</p>

<h2 id="part2theconference">Part 2: The Conference</h2>
<p>NDC Conferences are a well-oiled software developer conference machine. They have conferences in <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/">Oslo Norway</a>, <a href="http://ndc-london.com/">London UK</a>, and now <a href="http://ndcsydney.com/">Sydney Australia</a>. Every event I have been to has been consistently awesome. They have a very professional staff, a fantastic A/V crew, and the best food.</p>
<p>NDC record all of their sessions, and make them available soon after each event. Go check out their <a href="https://vimeo.com/ndcconferences">invaluable library of speaker recordings</a>!</p>
<p>I gave a refreshed version of my Node.js Crash Course (for .NET developers), including a bunch of new <a href="https://medium.com/@reverentgeek/captivate-your-audience-using-simple-illustrations-5bf0fcd0e301#.reirgq1nc">hand-drawn illustrations</a> for the audience to enjoy.</p>

<h2 id="bonusround">Bonus Round!</h2>
<p>While in Sydney, I saw a retweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/rvagg">Rod Vagg</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking for a speaker for Thursday&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nodejs?src=hash">#nodejs</a> meetup in Sydney! Ping me if you&#39;d like to talk about your Node adventures, favourite lib, etc</p>&mdash; Romain (@asyncadventures) <a href="https://twitter.com/asyncadventures/status/759907025618767872">August 1, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I reached out to the organizer, and ended up giving my Electron talk to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sydney-node-ninjas/events/228199767/?from=ref">Sydney Node Ninjas</a> meetup! They were a great audience, asked <em>lots</em> of questions, and even laughed at my jokes! Or, maybe they were just laughing at my redneck English... ;)</p>

<h2 id="awouldtravelagain">A++++ would travel again</h2>
<p>I had an amazing time. I will definitely do it again, if I ever get the opportunity. My only regret is not having more time to explore more of Australia outside of Sydney.</p>
