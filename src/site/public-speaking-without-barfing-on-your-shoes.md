[Nodevember](http://nodevember.org/) 2016 was an amazing conference that included some of my favorite talks of the year. And, as is usually the case, a lot of the value of the conference came from the folks I met and the incredible conversations we had.

This year I had the privilege of speaking at Nodevember on the topic of, well... _public speaking_. I've been doing this a while, and feel like I've learned a few insights.

Nodevember's sessions are 30 minutes. I've given this talk a couple of times, but previously had an hour. I seriously struggled with eliminating content from my talk that I felt was important. Cutting it down to 30 minutes forced me to focus and refine my message. I'm happy with how it turned out.

* Here is my recommended [list of resources](https://github.com/reverentgeek/public-speaking) on public speaking.
* Here is a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSZHCj84JSDOsQJj3CGaGIB6bjt72eP_C) of all the recorded videos from Nodevember 2016. Check them out!
