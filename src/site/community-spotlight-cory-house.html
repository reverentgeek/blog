<p>Perhaps you've seen one of Cory's <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cory-house">Pluralsight courses</a>. Or, sat in one of his talks. Perhaps you've run across his <a href="https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot">react-slingshot</a> React + Redux starter kit.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, &quot;This guy seems really nice. I wonder if he's this nice in 'real life'?&quot;</p>
<p>I've had the pleasure of crossing paths with Cory at conferences for many years. I can tell you. He's the real deal.</p>
<p>Every conversation I've had with Cory, I've come away inspired. He's not only courteous and respectful, I sincerely believe he listens and <em>values</em> everyone's opinions.</p>
<p>Cory, thank you for not only doing awesome work, but lifting the developer community in so many ways.</p>
