<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Being &quot;good enough&quot; is not good enough.</strong></p>
<p>Switchfoot recently released an album named <em><a title="Vice Verses" href="http://www.amazon.com/Vice-Verses/dp/B005MW5G1E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320233645&amp;sr=8-1">Vice Verses</a></em> that has struck a chord with my life (pardon the pun). Here's the chorus from one of the album's songs.</p>
<blockquote>No, I'm not alright
I know that I'm not right
A steering wheel doesn't mean you can drive
A warm body doesn't mean I'm alive
<p>No, I'm not alright<br>
I know that I'm not right<br>
Feel like I travel but I never arrive<br>
I wanna thrive not just survive</p>
<p>-- Switchfoot, Thrive</blockquote><br>
There's a scene in the movie <em><a href="http://www.courageousthemovie.com/">Courageous</a></em> where one character says, &quot;You've been a good enough father.&quot; To which the second replies, &quot;I don't want to be a 'good enough' father.&quot; Later, that same character says,</p>
<blockquote>"I don't feel like I started well. I want to finish well."</blockquote>
There are many areas of my life where I don't want to settle for "good enough."
<ul>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" husband.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" father.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" friend.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" boss.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" employee.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" software developer.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" musician.</li>
	<li>I don't want to be a "good enough" mentor.</li>
	<li>I want to thrive, not just survive.</li>
</ul>
<div>I believe there's no such thing as standing still. You're either pushing yourself forward, or you're drifting backwards.</div><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->
