<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Last week I had the privilege of being a part of <a href="http://codepalousa.com/">Code PaLOUsa</a> in Louisville, KY. I have spoken at Code PaLOUsa conferences in the past, but this was my first time attending as a speaker and a sponsor.</p>

<p>Being a sponsor gave me a small glimpse into how hard the volunteers work to make this great conference such a wonderful success. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadwickgreen">Chad Green</a> and his staff have a passion for the community, and are Just Good People<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to attend many sessions. However, the opportunities to connect with developers and other speakers made the trip <em>all worthwhile</em>.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed giving my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reverentgeek/do-you-even-kanban">&quot;Do you even Kanban?&quot;</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reverentgeek/intro-to-nodejs-for-net-developers">&quot;Intro to Node.js&quot;</a> talks. I received a lot of helpful feedback.</p>

<p>One thing I found out on this trip is the <a href="http://www.louisvillemegacavern.com/">Louisville Mega Cavern</a>. It's a limestone quarry turned into an underground park with zip lines, ropes course, and <strong>17</strong> miles of bike trails! Next time I come to Louisville, I must check this out!</p>

<p>Thanks Code PaLOUsa for another great conference! Thank you for the support and opportunities to speak! See you all again next time!</p>
