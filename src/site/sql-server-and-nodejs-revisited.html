<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A little more than a year ago, I wrote about accessing <a href="http://tech.pro/tutorial/1852/how-to-leverage-sql-server-with-nodejs-using-edgejs">SQL Server from Node.js using Edge.js</a>. Technology can change a lot in a year, and I'm happy to report the Node.js modules for SQL Server have greatly improved. Not only that, but some of the brilliant developers I work with at <a href="http://leankit.com">LeanKit</a> have created <a href="">seriate</a>, designed to make working with SQL Server from Node.js as painless and friction-free as possible.</p>
<p>I've written an <a href="http://developer.leankit.com/painless-sql-server-with-nodejs-and-seriate/">introduction to seriate</a> over on our new and shiny <a href="http://developer.leankit.com">LeanKit Developer Blog</a>. It really is a wonderful approach to managing data in SQL Server, and I hope you check it out.</p>
<p>By the way, seriate is just &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot; among the amazing catalog of open source projects available at <a href="https://github.com/leankit-labs">LeanKit Labs</a>. Expect to see more articles on these projects in the future!</p>
