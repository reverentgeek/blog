<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I'm excited to announce that my &quot;Introduction to RavenDB: NoSQL is Rapping at Your Door&quot; presentation that I gave at <a href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash 2012</a> was recorded by InfoQ is <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Introducing-RavenDB-NoSQL-is-Rapping-at-Your-Door">now available</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first year to CodeMash, and it was an absolute blast for me AND my family. Here are just two reasons to go next year: indoor water park and bacon bar. Need I say more? CodeMash 2012 sold out in just 20 minutes, so you better start getting ready for 2013.</p>
<p>I'll being giving a similar (but much improved) version of this talk at <a href="http://codepalousa.com/">CodepaLOUsa 2012</a> in Louisville, KY, March 15-17. Hope to see you there!</p>
