Each year for the last several years, I have ridden my motorcycle to [CodeStock](http://www.codestock.org/) in Knoxville, TN. Not very far from Knoxville is some of the most beautiful, scenic roads in the entire USA.

My favorite is the [Cherohala Skyway](http://cherohala.org/). The Cherohala Skyway reaches over 5,400 feet elevation with amazing views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Highway 129, known world-wide by motorcyle and car enthusiasts as "[The Tail of the Dragon](http://tailofthedragon.com/)", is a rollercoaster ride of 318 curves in just 11 miles. I look forward to this trip all year. What would make the trip even better is to share the experience with _you_.

If you've ever followed one of the old Tech\*Ed conferences or a Microsoft MVP Summit, you may have heard about an unofficial event "Party with Palermo." For many years, [Jeffrey Palermo](https://twitter.com/jeffreypalermo) has put together a great gathering of geeks, to socialize and have fun.

Taking inspiration from "Party with Palermo," I've come up with my own event: "**Ride with ReverentGeek**." If you're keen to see some of the most beautiful sights in all creation, I would love for you to join me in riding/driving from Tellico Plains, TN to Knoxville, TN, taking in the Cherohala Skyway and "The Tail of the Dragon" along the way.
