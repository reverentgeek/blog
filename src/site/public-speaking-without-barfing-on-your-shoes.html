<p><a href="http://nodevember.org/">Nodevember</a> 2016 was an amazing conference that included some of my favorite talks of the year. And, as is usually the case, a lot of the value of the conference came from the folks I met and the incredible conversations we had.</p>
<p>This year I had the privilege of speaking at Nodevember on the topic of, well... <em>public speaking</em>. I've been doing this a while, and feel like I've learned a few insights.</p>
<p>Nodevember's sessions are 30 minutes. I've given this talk a couple of times, but previously had an hour. I seriously struggled with eliminating content from my talk that I felt was important. Cutting it down to 30 minutes forced me to focus and refine my message. I'm happy with how it turned out.</p>
