## Leadership Guide for the Reluctant Leader

Regardless of the technology you know or the job title you have, you have amazing potential to impact your workplace, community, and beyond.

In this talk, I'll share candid stories of my career failures… I mean… learning opportunities. We'll start by debunking the myth that leadership == management. Next, we'll talk about some of the attributes, behaviors, and skills of good leaders. Lastly, we'll cover some practical steps and resources to accelerate your journey.

You'll walk away with essential leadership skills anyone can develop and a good dose of encouragement to be more awesome!

_Note: I've given this talk several times as both a keynote and a presentation._

## JavaScript: Past, Present, and Future

Ah, JavaScript! Like it or not, it's a "tragically important" language that is "eating the world." Hate it? Love it? Avoid it? Embrace it?

## JAMstack: Web Apps at Ludicrous Speed

If you're a web developer, you may have heard of "JAMstack." JAMstack isn't a solution to prevent clogged printers, something to eat on toast, or a way to make music. Instead, it's an architecture for designing super-fast web applications that easily scale.

In this talk, we'll cover the JAMstack architecture, the numerous benefits of the JAMstack approach, and tools you can use to implement a JAMstack web application. You'll walk away with a clear understanding of JAMstack and resources to quickly build your web app at ludicrous speed!

## Software and The Art of Delivery

Engineering, DevOps, IT, Marketing, ...you name it, there is a constant battle between going fast and doing it right. Add to the mix that coordination across teams and departments comes at a high transaction cost. How can we minimize friction?

During my time at LeanKit, we continuously strove to improve our processes across the entire organization. Along the way, we developed FSGD, which distills many of the core lean (and agile) principles into an easy-to-remember and easy-to-communicate thinking tool to make better decisions about your work.

In this talk, I'll share the challenges we faced as we scaled, how we struggled, what we learned, and how we evolved. The goal is to walk away with tools and practical processes to impact your team's success.

_Note: I have given this talk as both a keynote and presentation._

## The Illustrated Guide to Node.js

Node.js is a compelling platform for building all types of applications for startups to enterprises. Node.js strategically unites developers through the universal language of JavaScript. Or TypeScript! Why should you learn Node.js, and where do you start?

## Public Speaking without Barfing on Your Shoes

Sooner or later, it's going to happen. You're going to have to speak. Out loud. In front of an audience. Public speaking is scary!

I have spoken at conferences, user groups, and meetups for many years. However, as a shy introvert, this does not come naturally to me! If I can do it, so can you! In this fun and light-hearted talk, I want to share what I have learned from my hard-won experience. You will walk away with practical tips on preparing and giving effective presentations.

<a name="kanban"></a>

## Take Back Project Sanity: The Kanban Journey

Kanban is just sticky notes on a whiteboard, right? There's more to this methodology than you might think. Kanban harnesses the power of visual information to turn your team's work into brain candy. However, visualization is only the beginning.

Whether you work in software development, operations, or professional cat wrangling, Kanban can help you continuously improve your process (yes, you have one!). That can help your team boost delivery speed, predictability, and quality.

In this fun and entertaining talk, you'll learn Kanban's core principles and practices and how to maximize its potential to evolve how you, your team, and your organization works.

## Sketchnotes: How Drawing Can Supercharge Learning

Have you ever sat in a presentation where an artist captured a summary on an artboard using graphics and word art? It's fascinating to watch! You might think,

Well, you can! Visual note-taking, or "sketchnotes," is a fun and powerful way to learn, think about information, and solve problems.

Regardless of your artistic ability, you can add simple illustrations to your notes to help you remain engaged and focused and increase your learning.

In this talk, I want to share techniques to improve your note-taking system. You will walk away with the tools and resources to radically transform and improve how you learn, process information, and communicate ideas!

## Visual Storytelling: How to be a Superhuman Communicator

Who says communication has to be dry, dull, and boring? Simple, hand-drawn illustrations are a compelling and fun way to engage, inform, and win your audience of readers and viewers!

Drawing is a skill that anyone can learn. There's no such thing as "bad" art! You can make a huge impact with some fundamentals and practice, and have fun doing it!
