If you've ever wanted to relive the glory days of the internet‚Äîback when guestbooks, under-construction GIFs, and visit counters reigned supreme‚Äîthis one's for you.

In this tutorial, we're building **HopCounter**: a bunny-themed, edge-powered page view counter that runs globally, updates instantly, and doesn't need a single origin server. It's a nostalgic nod to the web's past, rebuilt for the modern CDN.

And we're doing it all with **Bunny.net Edge Scripting**‚Äîno backend server to build, no complex deploy pipelines. Just you, a browser, and some delightful JavaScript in the Bunny admin console.

## Why build a view counter at the edge?

You might be thinking, "Okay, but why?" Fair question. Besides satisfying your inner 90s kid, here are real reasons you might want to build this:

- **Fun dynamic content** to add interactivity on JAMstack sites
- **Landing page analytics** without third-party scripts or trackers
- **Time- or rate-limited content** to control access to dynamic content

Traditional counters rely on backend services or analytics platforms. Edge Scripting lets you **skip the backend entirely**, run logic closer to users, and maintain control over what happens when someone visits your page.

## Requirements

Before we start hopping, you'll need the following:

- A [Bunny.net](https://bunny.net/) account (sign up for a [FREE trial](https://dash.bunny.net/auth/register))
- A page where you want to show the counter
- Access to a key-value store, external API, or in-memory edge-compatible service (we'll simulate this)

We'll use JavaScript to build a `GET /view?id={slug}` endpoint that:

- Increments a counter for the given `id`
- Returns the updated count in JSON

Let's hop in!

## Step 1: Create a new script in the Bunny dashboard

The first step is to add a new script to your Bunny account. You will deploy the script directly from your Bunny dashboard, but you can also deploy scripts using a [GitHub repository](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/edge-scripting-github-integration) or [GitHub Actions](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/edge-scripting-github-action)!

1. Log in to your [Bunny Dashboard](https://dash.bunny.net/)
2. Navigate to **Edge Platform ‚Üí Scripting**
3. Click **Add Script**

![Bunny Scripting: add script](/content/images/hopcounter-bunny-edge-scripting/bunny-edge-scripting-01.png)

4. Click **Deploy with Bunny.net**

![Bunny Scripting: deploy with Bunny.net](/content/images/hopcounter-bunny-edge-scripting/bunny-edge-scripting-02.png)

5. For **Script Name** enter "HopCounter"
6. Make sure the script **Type** is set to **Standalone**
7. Under **Script Template** choose **Return simple JSON** (although any template will work)
8. Click **Add Script**

## Step 2: Replace the default script

Here's a super basic example that simulates incrementing a view counter. It uses an in-memory counter for demonstration.

```javascript
import * as BunnySDK from "https://esm.sh/@bunny.net/edgescript-sdk@0.11.2";

// This object simulates a data store (it resets on each cold start!)
const counters = new Map();

BunnySDK.net.http.serve(async (request) => {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const id = url.searchParams.get("id");

  if (!id) {
    return new Response("Missing `id` query parameter", { status: 400 });
  }

  const current = counters.get(id) ?? 0;
  const updated = current + 1;
  counters.set(id, updated);
  const data = JSON.stringify({id, count: updated});

  return new Response(data, {
    headers: {
      "content-type": "application/json"
    }
  });
});
```

> Note: Edge Scripting is built on [Deno](https://deno.com/), so you can use TypeScript or just good ol' JavaScript.

## Step 3: Test it in the preview pane

The Bunny dashboard includes a **preview pane** for testing your script. You can:

- Update the URL parameters such as `?id=test`
- Click the run button and see the JSON response
- View logs in real time

![Bunny Scripting: preview pane](/content/images/hopcounter-bunny-edge-scripting/bunny-edge-scripting-05.png)

This can be a great tool to debug and tweak your script without leaving your browser.

## Step 4: Add it to your website

Let's display the counter on your webpage with some basic JavaScript:

```html
<div id="counter">Loading view count...</div>
<script>
  fetch("https://<your-hopcounter-url>.bunnycdn.run/view?id=homepage")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      const padded = String(data.count).padStart(5, "0");
      document.getElementById("counter").textContent = `You are visitor #${padded} üêá`;
    });
</script>
```

Replace `<your-hopcounter-url>` with your unique script name. You can find this at the top of the Code Editor. You can reuse this snippet for any page by changing the `id=homepage` parameter. Each slug (e.g., "homepage," "about," and "contact") gets its own counter.

## Bonus enhancements for extra ~~credit~~ carrots

Once you've got the basics running, here's how to level it up:

- **Add persistent storage**: To persist data across restarts and deployments, you'll want to connect this to a real data store, such as [Turso](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/access-edge-database-with-turso), Redis, Couchbase, or any number of cloud database providers. Bunny's own **Edge Database Lite** is [coming soon](https://bunny.net/blog/edge-scripting-just-evolved-faster-safer-and-even-more-powerful/)!
 You can set [environment variables](https://docs.bunny.net/docs/edge-scripting-environment-variables-and-secrets) for your database credentials and connection string and import the database client library into your script using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/).
- **Style it retro**: Use pixel fonts, counters that look like odometers, an animated GIF, or make it blink like it's 1999!
- **Add daily/weekly limits**: Store counts with timestamps for limited-access content.
- **Track per-user visits**: Use headers or tokens to enforce custom logic.

## Edge Scripting real-world use cases

HopCounter is just a cute wrapper around a much bigger idea: running lightweight, dynamic logic at the edge without needing a server. If you can build a page view counter, you can build lots of useful features! Here are just a few ideas to keep you hopping!

| Concept               | Real Use Case Example                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Edge-based counters   | Blog views, download stats, or video play counts     |
| Upvote APIs           | Let users cast a single upvote per item instantly |
| Feature flags         | Dynamically enable or disable features |
| Event tracking        | Button clicks, form submissions, or popup dismisses  |
| Limited-time promos   | Serve time-based content or discounts that automatically activate and expire using edge logic and middleware |
| Per-user limits       | Rate-limiting anonymous visits (e.g., 3 previews/day)|
| Email sign-ups        | Collect and validate email addresses at the edge, then forward them securely to a mailing list provider via API |
| A/B testing           | Deliver different versions of a page or element to users |

Because your logic runs at the edge, you can **respond instantly and at scale**‚Äîno latency from centralized APIs or bloated trackers. All from the Bunny dashboard, deployed globally in seconds.
