I've been in Franklin, TN this week for meetings at [LeanKit](http://leankit.com). I made the decision to stay through the weekend before heading off to [Code PaLOUsa](http://codepalousa.com/) in Louisville, KY.

It's Saturday, and I wake up this morning to much better weather than expected. Over breakfast at the Cracker Barrel off Highway 96 and I-65, I decide to take advantage of this weather with a ride in the area.

## Franklin Main Street Festival

My original plan is to drive straight through Franklin. To my surprise, downtown Franklin is blocked off for the [Main Street Festival](http://historicfranklin.com/events/event/main-street-festival/). I decide to park the bike for a bit, and check out what the buzz is all about.

## Leiper's Fork

After buying some cheese and a bow tie, I get back on the road. I take West Main Street out of Franklin, turn right on Southall Road, and follow signs to Leiper's Fork, TN. [Puckett's Grocery](http://www.puckettsofleipersfork.com/) looks so inviting, I have to stop. Puckett's Grocery is a traditional Southern "meat-n-three," but I persuade them to give me three meats and 2 vegetables instead. It is all delicious.

## Old State Highway 96

After filling my belly at Puckett's, I take the next right on to Old State Highway 96. What a beautiful stretch of road! The topographical map showed this road going through wooded hills, and the scenery did not disappoint. The road itself was a but rough in areas, though. Loose gravel and poorly patched sections of road are frustrating, but I still enjoy the view immensely.

Running into Highway 96, I turn left. Where Highway 96 meets Highway 100, I turn right and drive to the famous [Loveless Cafe](http://www.lovelesscafe.com/).

## Natchez Trace Parkway

Less than a mile from the Loveless Cafe is the start of the 444-mile scenic [Natchez Trace Parkway](http://www.nps.gov/natr/index.htm). The Natchez Trace is a quiet, scenic road with gentle curves and breathtaking views. I make a few stops for pictures along the way. I wish I could ride more, but I jump off the parkway where it intersects Highway 46 near Leiper's Fork and retrace my steps back to Franklin.

## Summary

The destinations are great. Old Highway 96 and Natchez Trace Parkway are two more cases where I wish I had a GoPro or similar video camera. These roads must be seen on two wheels, or at least with the top down!
