(Or any application icon, for that matter.)

The orange Visual Studio Code icon seemed to rub a lot of people the wrong way. So much so, Microsoft is [changing it](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/24/theicon) in the next release.

Some folks were so displeased with the "pumpkin spice" icon, they started replacing it with something else.

I came up with a couple of my own variations, reminiscent of our old MS Office friend, Clippy.

You can download the files for Windows or Mac at: [https://github.com/reverentgeek/vs-code-icons](https://github.com/reverentgeek/vs-code-icons)

Let me know if you have any suggestions or requests for your own custom icons!

You are now operating in beast mode.

## How to change an application icon on Windows

While it is technically possible to change an application's icon in Windows by carefully modifying the `.exe` file (not for the faint of heart!), the only practical thing you can do is change the shortcut.

* Download or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reverentgeek/vs-code-icons)
* Launch the VS Code application
* Right-click the running application and pin the application to your taskbar (if you haven't already)
* Close the application
* Shift+Right+Click the pinned application on the taskbar
* Click "Properties"

* Click the "Change Icon" button

* Click the "Browse..." button

* Locate the desired `.ico` file and click "Open"

At least your pinned application looks awesome!
