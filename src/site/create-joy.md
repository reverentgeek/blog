You may have heard the idea of "make your own luck." It's a common theme in "hustle culture" where the harder you work, the more connections you make, the more obstacles you overcome, you increase the opportunities for good fortune that others might see as "luck."

Along similar lines, I believe you can create joy. Learn a new skill. Create a new routine. Move more. Get outdoors. Be kind to someone. Guard what you put into your mind and your body. Make a stand. Face your fears. Complete a task with excellence. Small, incremental improvements over time make a significant impact!
