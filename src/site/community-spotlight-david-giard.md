Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you [David Giard](https://twitter.com/davidgiard), the hardest working man in developer relations! Like Visa, he is everywhere you want to be.

David is not only one of my speaker heroes, he is a mentor and inspiration. Every encounter with David I've walked away feeling blessed. His positive attitude overflows into everything he does. I especially appreciate his daily goal of sharing at least one thing he is grateful for.

Here's a small example:
