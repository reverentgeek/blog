I recently had the honor of presenting my "Node.js for .NET Developers" talk for the the [Microsoft MVP Virtual Conference](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualconference.aspx). The recording of that talk is now available on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MVP-Virtual-Conference/MVP-Virtual-Conference-Americas-2015/DEV-Track-Day1-Nodejs-for-NET-Developers). I would appreciate your feedback!
